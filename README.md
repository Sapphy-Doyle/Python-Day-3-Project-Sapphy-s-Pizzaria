Day 3 project of the 100 Days of Code: Python Challenge.
<br/>A really simple pizzaria styled calculator that questions the user on their choice and calculates their bill
<br/>I used this to learn if/elif statements, it was a practice sandbox while I did so.
<br/>I also used it as a chance to reinforce my knowledge regarding f.strings and updating to variables.
